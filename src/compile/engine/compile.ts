/**
 * engineCompile — the SHARED engine compile seam (one place, two front-ends).
 *
 * The CLI (`ada compile --engine`, `ada ctx init --compile`) and the Ink TUI's "Compile an
 * idea" flow both need the SAME end-to-end pipeline:
 *
 *   engineSeed(intent) (or an injected richer Seed, AXIOM A2)
 *     → proposeClusters   (ONE compile-time model call → domain-appropriate areas; P7)
 *        (or an explicit `opts.clusters` override, skipping the proposal)
 *     → excavatePack      (compile-time model calls per cluster; model-free gate, A3)
 *     → assemblePackGated (pack Seed + cluster label registry DERIVED, never a literal)
 *     → writePack         (the pack lands on disk)
 *
 * Factoring it here means the TUI and CLI cannot drift. The model is INJECTABLE
 * (`opts.model?: ModelClient`, default `anthropicClient(...)`) so tests stub it and NO live
 * call happens — the only module permitted a network is `engine/model.ts` (AXIOM A1/A9). This
 * module holds no network token (grep-guarded by the orchestrate boundary test's siblings).
 *
 * Multiple COMPILE-TIME calls are fine under A1/A9; what they forbid is a runtime /
 * post-compile call. The gate inside `excavatePack` stays model-free (A3).
